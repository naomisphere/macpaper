## Manual
---
> [!IMPORTANT]
> After downloading and trying to launch the app, you will receive a text saying that it is from an unidentified developer.
> This is because I do not own an Apple Developer account. To fix this:
> 1. Open **System Settings** > **Privacy & Security**
> 2. Scroll down and find the warning about the app
> 3. Click **Open Anyway**
>
> You only need to do this once.

## License
macpaper is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3). See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details.

## üî® Building from Source
- Clone the repo
- ```cd``` into app
- ```sh build.sh```

## üâëÔ∏è Translating
Contributing to translation is pretty simple and straightforward -partly because there are not many strings to translate-. Fork the repo, grab the template on the [lang](./lang) folder (or an already existing strings file), and replace the value of the keys with the ones respective to your language. Then, upload the translation to lang/{lang}.lproj and submit a pull request.

It is advised that you, alongside the strings file, place a file named `credit` with a link to your GitHub profile, or just your username.

## ü§ù Thanks to
- [Boring Notch](https://github.com/TheBoredTeam/boring.notch), for README inspiration
- [This post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34215527/what-does-launchd-status-78-mean-why-my-user-agent-not-running), because it stopped me from going insane

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
### Quarantine
If you suspect the app is quarantined, run the following on your Terminal after dragging the app to Applications:
```bash
xattr -l /Applications/macpaper.app
```
Which shall output ```com.apple.quarantine: ...;{BROWSER};``` if the app IS quarantined.
In that case, run:
```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/macpaper.app
```

### Apple could not verify "macpaper" is free of malware...
You can fix this by doing the same steps as [here](https://github.com/naomisphere/macpaper/tree/main/README.md#installation).
